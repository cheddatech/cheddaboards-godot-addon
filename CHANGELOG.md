# Changelog

All notable changes to the CheddaBoards Godot 4 SDK will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This repo is the standalone home of the SDK from v2.2.5 onwards. History for v2.2.4 and earlier lives in the [cheddaboards-godot changelog](https://github.com/cheddatech/CheddaBoards-Godot/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md), where the SDK previously shipped as part of the full template.

## v2.2.6 (2026-09-04)

### ⚠️ Behavior change
- `get_leaderboard()` default limit is now **100** entries (was 1000),
  matching every other getter. Pass a limit explicitly if you need
  deeper results: `get_leaderboard("score", 1000)`. To find a specific
  player's position, use `get_player_rank()` instead of scanning the
  board.

### Fixed
- **Batch achievement signals**: the async batch path skipped response
  handling entirely, so batch unlocks synced server-side but
  `achievement_unlocked` / `achievements_loaded` never fired and
  internal sync counters were left dirty. Batches now go through a
  dedicated sender with a real completion handler — both signals fire
  with the confirmed ids.

### Changed
- **Read de-duplication**: an identical read request (same endpoint)
  that is already queued or in flight is dropped instead of being sent
  twice — the caller still gets its signal from the request already on
  the wire. Applies to idempotent reads only (leaderboards, ranks,
  profiles, scoreboards, archives, achievements); score submits and
  other writes are never de-duplicated.
  
## [2.2.5] - 2026-09-01

### Leaderboards, Direct from the Canister

Backwards-compatible release. Leaderboard reads now come straight from the CheddaBoards canister over the IC HTTP gateway instead of routing through the API proxy — noticeably faster board loads with no cold-start lag, and an automatic proxy fallback so nothing gets less reliable. Also hardens the SDK's internal request dispatch against a rare race. No breaking changes, no migration required.

### Added

**Direct Canister Reads (`CheddaBoards.gd`)**

- `get_scoreboard()` — and the `get_weekly_leaderboard()` / `get_daily_leaderboard()` / `get_alltime_leaderboard()` / `get_monthly_leaderboard()` helpers built on it — now fetches straight from the CheddaBoards canister (`fdvph-sqaaa-aaaap-qqc4a-cai.raw.icp0.io`), skipping the proxy hop entirely
- The response is byte-for-byte the same shape as the proxy's, so existing `scoreboard_loaded` handlers work unchanged — same JSON, same signals, same everything from your game code's point of view
- Direct reads are keyless and header-free: public board data only, no API key travels on this path, and web exports stay CORS-simple with no preflight
- Writes, ranks, archive readers (`get_scoreboard_archives()`, `get_last_archived_scoreboard()`, `get_last_week_scoreboard()`, and friends), and all authenticated calls stay on the proxy unchanged

**Automatic Proxy Fallback**

- If a direct read can't get through — a network that filters `raw.icp0.io`, a gateway hiccup, a non-JSON gateway error page — the SDK silently retries the identical request via the proxy
- After three consecutive direct failures, the SDK stops trying direct for the rest of the session, so affected players pay the detour cost at most three times and then behave exactly like v2.2.4
- One direct success resets the failure count
- A genuine `"Scoreboard not found"` from the canister is treated as the real answer, not retried — the canister is the source of truth

### Fixed

**Request Dispatch Race**

- Internal retries now route through the SDK's request queue instead of grabbing the `HTTPRequest` node directly, `_process_next_request()` guards against double-dispatch, and a busy node requeues the request for the next idle frame instead of dropping it with an error
- Fixes rare `HTTPRequest is processing a request` errors (and silently lost requests) when completions and queued requests landed in the same frame
